Since version 3.0 of dtools, you need bash4.

Since version 2.0 of dtools, the dt.known_hosts file (AKA dt_lst) format has
changes. Basically, the tags are now in a different column each one, instead
on one only colum.

This not affect to the normal use of the ssh client if you use ssh against
the dt.known_hosts, but do not work with versions >= 2.0 of dt. So please
update your tags, you can use the tagconvert script in the contrib/
directory.

Thanks and enjoy!
