Q: When performs a distributed ssh over a number of hosts, I got the
   message::

   "fail::dt:ssh:anyhostname:No RSA host key is known for anyhostname and
   you have reque\nHost key verification failed."

A: When use the ssh command, you really invoke to ssh binary in background,
   so you need to have the hosts added in your known_host database before.
   Do "ssh-keyscan yourhost >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts" to add host key to
   known hosts database. Also, you can simply log in manually to host
   before. Once the key has retrieved you can use dt without problems.

Q: When performs a distributed ssh over a number of hosts, I got the
   message::

   "fail::dt:ssh:127.0.0.1:Permission denied
   (publickey,keyboard-interactive)."

A: When use the ssh command, you really invoke to ssh binary in background,
   so if you do not enabled the interactive mode (-i), dtools do not ask you
   for password interactively, and try to connect to using public key, but
   if this do not exists, then failed. Try to run your command with -i flag
   or, better, send your public key to the hosts via the ssh-copy-id
   command.

Q: When performs a distributed sudo over a number of hosts, I got the
   message::

   "fail::dt:sudo:localhost:sudo: sorry, a password
   is required to run sudo"

A: You are running dtools in non-interactive mode, ssh works fine, so
   probably you've already distributed your public key via ssh-copy-id,
   but you have sudo configured to ask for password, so you need to
   force dtools to be interactive yet, just add flag -i on dtools options.
   If you want to run commands in absolutely non-interactive, please
   add NOPASSWD option in sudo. Read sudoers(5) man page for more
   information.

Q: WTF with the format?!
A: The dtools use an OMNI format to output data, the basics of OMNI format
   is similar to /etc/passwd format, a columns separated by two colons.
   There an example for dtools::

   "okay::dt:ssh:host:blah"

   The "okay" key (called return code) will be one of the following:
   okay (if the dt command was successfully for host), fail (if
   something wrong) and type if user interactively was required (only
   in interactive mode).

   The encoding (which is empty in our example) is how the data in output
   (see below) is encoding. We only use two encodings, the empty encoding
   which pass the output in raw, without any conversion, and the "hidden"
   encoding, which avoid to print echo for passwords.

   The dt and ssh fields indicate the command that we are running.

   The host shows the host over we working.

   The "blah" is the output of the command.


Q: How to handle with spaces in arguments of remote script with script
   command, for example::

   dt sys:blah script ./myscript "one two"

   instead of

   dt sys:blah script ./myscript one two

A: If you want to pass a white space to final script (your script) to run
   remotely, you need to pass the argument as one argument to dt, and also
   scape comas too (to pass correctly number of arguments to background
   ssh), for example:

   dt sys:blah script /bin/cat /etc/passwd /etc/group

   will produce an output of both files (passwd and group), but

   dt sys:blah script /bin/cat '\"/etc/passwd /etc/group\"'

   will produce an error (file not found, because white space is considerer
   as part of filename).
