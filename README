dtools
======
Distributed tools, aka dtools is a project written in bash coding to
create a suite of programs to allow running different UNIX commands
in parallel in a list of tagged hosts. This utility is based on
capistrano for Ruby or fabric for Python, but in pure bash.

Features
--------

* Fully written in bash, no third party software required
  (except ssh, obviously).
* Based in module architecture, easy to extend.
* Full integration with ssh.
* Easy to group hosts by tags or search by regular expression.
* Parseable output, but human-readable
* A number of output printers with different formats
* Thinking in system admin, no special development skills
  required to extend the software.

Short Example
-------------

    $ dt exp:*linux* ssh date
    okay myhostlinux1.domain Mon Nov 16 23:54:04 CET 2009
    okay myhostlinux3.domain Mon Nov 16 23:54:04 CET 2009
    okay myhostlinux2.domain Mon Nov 16 23:54:04 CET 2009

    $ dt -o dot exp:* ping
    ......X..
    fail myhostlinux3.domain Host unreachable
