dtools
======
Distributed tools, aka dtools is a project written in bash coding to
create a suite of programs to allow running different UNIX commands
in parallel in a list of tagged hosts. This utility is based on
capistrano for Ruby or fabric for Python, but in pure bash.

Features
--------

* Fully written in bash, no third party software required
  (except ssh, obviously).
* Based in module architecture, easy to extend.
* Full integration with ssh.
* Easy to group hosts by tags or search by regular expression.
* Parseable output, but human-readable
* Thinking in system admin, no special development skills
  required to extend the software.

Short Example
-------------

    $ dt tag:linux ssh date
    okay::dt:ssh:myhostlinux1.domain:Mon Nov 16 23:54:04 CET 2009
    okay::dt:ssh:myhostlinux3.domain:Mon Nov 16 23:54:04 CET 2009
    okay::dt:ssh:myhostlinux2.domain:Mon Nov 16 23:54:04 CET 2009
