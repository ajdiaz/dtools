Distributed tools
=================

The ``dtools`` project provide a suite of tools to manage a number of hosts
distributely, using the ssh protocol and PKI infraestructure based on SSH
key pairs or SMIME certificates if there are supported in the SSH
deployment.

There are three important concepts in dtools design: the *database*, which is,
in really (and for now) a known_host format file. This file use standard
known_host format [1]_, and use one of the comment field as tag storage. For
example get the following output::


    localhost ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIw99xsWpVx5BmrfMKZdhZTT7zE2hw==
    foo.onehost,83.981.654.55 ssh-rsa AAAAB3ToQ9U=
    bar.onehost,193.456.891 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzXQiopyw0J1L+cK1JGhmzn/LC88Q==
    blah.onehost ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAAopyw0J1L+cK1JGhmzn/LC88Q== tag:servers,zeries

In this example the last host, called ``blah.onehost`` is tagged with tags
servers and zeries.

The second important concept are the *access*, in a cloud infraestructure,
which uses ssh protocol fpr dtools, we call access to the ``authorized_keys``
file which authenticate each node.

And finally the third concept is the *keys*. The keys is dtools are the
public keys for each node which are recognised for the rest of the machines.
Not enough clearly?

:keys: the \*.pub files in ``~/.ssh`` directory
:access: the ``authorized_keys`` in ``~/.ssh`` directory
:database: the ``known_hosts`` file in ``~/.ssh`` directory

Really, we use out concepts when we talk in general for all nodes of the
cloud, and keep the file names when we talk about one specific node.
